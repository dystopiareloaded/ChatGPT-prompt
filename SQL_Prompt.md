## 📌 Project Overview

I am currently working on a Kaggle dataset titled **"Spotify Dataset by Sanjan Chaudhari"**.  
This project aims to generate **20 SQL questions with solutions**, categorized from **easy to advanced** levels.

The questions are designed from both a **Data Analyst** and **Business Consultant** perspective, focusing on extracting actionable **business insights**.  
Each query will be framed in a **real-world business context**, making this project suitable for inclusion in a professional **SQL project portfolio**.

## 🧠 Query Complexity Breakdown

### ✅ Easy Level
- Basic data retrieval using `SELECT`
- Filtering using `WHERE`
- Simple aggregations: `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`

---

### ⚙️ Medium Level
- Grouping with `GROUP BY`
- Aggregation functions on grouped data
- Joins (if multiple tables exist)
- Conditional logic using `CASE`

---

### 🚀 Advanced Level
- Nested subqueries  
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- Window functions like `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`  
- Time-based trends and analyses (e.g., top artists by month)

---

## ⚡ Query Optimization (Advanced)

In later stages, query performance tuning will be addressed using:

- 📌 **Indexing**: Add indexes to frequently queried columns  
- 🧪 **Query Execution Plans**: Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to evaluate and optimize performance
