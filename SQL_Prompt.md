## 📂 Dataset
**Kaggle Link:** [Spotify Dataset by Sanjan Chaudhari](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjanchaudhari/spotify-dataset)

---

## 🎯 Objective
Acting as a **Data Analyst and Business Consultant**, the goal is to generate **20 SQL questions with solutions** using this dataset. The questions will range from **easy to advanced levels**, aimed at uncovering key **business insights** and enhancing your **SQL project portfolio**.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

- 📊 Business Insights  
- 📈 Aggregations and Filtering  
- 🧠 Subqueries and CTEs (`WITH` clause)  
- 🗓️ Date and Time-based Analysis  
- 🪟 Window Functions

---

## 🧠 Skill Progression

### ✅ Easy Level
- Simple data retrieval  
- Basic filtering using `WHERE`  
- Aggregations using `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, etc.

---

### ⚙️ Medium Level
- Grouping with `GROUP BY`  
- Joins between multiple tables (if applicable)  
- Conditional logic with `CASE`  
- Aggregation with grouping

---

### 🚀 Advanced Level
- Nested subqueries  
- Common Table Expressions (`WITH`)  
- Window functions like `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`  
- Analytical breakdowns across dimensions (e.g., month-over-month growth, most streamed genre by region)

---

## 🔧 Query Optimization (Advanced)

As your SQL complexity increases, focus on **performance tuning** through:

- 📌 **Indexing**: Add indexes on frequently queried columns.  
- 🧪 **Query Execution Plans**: Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to evaluate and refine query performance.

---

> 📝 **Note:** Each SQL question will be framed in a **real-world business context**, making them ideal for interviews or inclusion in your data analytics portfolio.
