I am working on this Kaggle dataset.  
**Dataset link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tadhgfitzgerald/fifa-international-soccer-mens-ranking-1993now

I want you to act as a data analyst and business consultant. Based on this dataset, generate **30 SQL questions with solutions**, ranging from easy to advanced levels.  

The questions should cover topics such as:
- Business Insights  
- Aggregations and Filtering  
- Subqueries and CTEs (WITH clause)  
- Date and Time-based analysis  
- Window Functions  

The focus should be on uncovering **key business insights and analytics**, with each question framed in a real-world business context. These questions should be suitable for inclusion in an SQL project portfolio.
